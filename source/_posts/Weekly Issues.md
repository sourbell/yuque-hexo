Long list here of issues and questions that need addressing immediately…

1. Trend continuing to crash every week – need to figure this out

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">I need more time to observe, not able to find the solution yet.</font>
>

2. Refuel
    1. custom levels not showing up on Crestview skin

>         1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">What are the members' emails, I need more details to investigate this issue. does the level never show on the screen, or only some of the members?</font>
>

    2. status of smoke

>         1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">I have a new solution and will try it recently, we can't relaunch this feature unless we can resolve the crash problem for good.</font>
>

3. Memory from chest straps not loading to Accurofit.

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">Double-checked (Boon, Svend, and Toby), working fine, needs further communication.</font>
>

4. When will Accurofit with new club logos be released?
5. Apple Watch integration

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">The watch stopped detecting heart rate, Svend thinks you need to restart the Apple Watch to resolve this problem, </font>
>

6. Zoo Gym Issues
    1. Admin cannot change classes because someone who no longer works there created class – I thought this was resolved

>         1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">We've double-checked the admin can change classes, but no one can change a class if it's already started.</font>
>

    2. API Feed on the website not loading classes

>         1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">I double-checked the API Feed is working fine, here is the script, the X-Authorization is for Zoo Gym only and it's sensitive, please do not send it to other clients.</font>
>

```powershell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.accuropt.com/open/clients/33/classes?startDate=2025/01/007&endDate=2025/01/14&locationId=97' \
--header 'X-AUTHORIZATION: a3578ef561183f9cf949b1e02aff9717'
```

7. Member at Trib3 sheffield Journey level is not reflected on APT. It is assigned correctly in the dashboard. He reported this also happened when he reached the 50 mark culluma1984@gmail.com

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">Please tell the client, whenever this happens, just update the member's profile manually and the system will sync the profile to the iPad.</font>
>

8. Peter at District has workout in Accurofit that is not showing up in dashboard. Sent an image on 1/9. The 1/8 workout shows on app but not on dashboard

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">The only possible reason is that he has a duplicated workout on his app, on the dashboard. Apparently he is using AccuroFit and AccuroPT together, just tell him to use only one to avoid this from happening.</font>
>

9. Can we make a similar skin for heartzone that Hitsona has? He says the names are hard to see on our standard skins.

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">Hisona designed the skin, so I'm not sure if we can let other clients to use it. Please ask Aaron.</font>
>

10. GTA Skin?

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">Had a flu, rested on Monday. Will be ready today.</font>
>

11. Hive Skin status?

>     1. <font style="background-color:#FCE75A;">Available on the store.</font>
